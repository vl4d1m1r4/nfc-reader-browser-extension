Goal: Create a browser extension that can read NfcA cards from an external USB connected reader.
Architecture: Background host app is a Java console app that is self contained and can run on any operating system (MacOS, Windows, Unix).
Resposibilities:
 - Java app has several commands:
  - Read connected readers
  - Listen on one of the connected readers that the read command detects and read the different types of UID of the nfc cards/tags
 - Browser extension:
  - Uses the CLI Java app to provide a configuration popup to select the available readers (by default select the first)
  - Can send listen command and on reading the serial from the Java app can input the data in a focused input on the current page.
Implementation guide:
 - Use DRY principle
 - Split the java app and broser extension in separate folders
 - Make it easy to test in development
 - Make sure it works for theACR122U reader
