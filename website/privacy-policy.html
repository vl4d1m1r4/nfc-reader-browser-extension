        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how the NFC Reader extension handles your data.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>Our philosophy is simple: your data belongs to you.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> The extension does not store, log, or archive any personal information or usage data from the user.</li>
            <li><strong>UID Reading Only:</strong> The extension is designed to strictly read the Unique Identifier (UID) from the connected smart card.</li>
            <li><strong>No Data Access:</strong> The extension does not access, read, or look into the encrypted or unencrypted data stored on the smart card itself. It only interacts with the card's serial number/UID.</li>
            <li><strong>No External Transmission:</strong> The UID read from the card is only used to populate the active field in your browser as requested. It is not sent to any external servers by the extension.</li>
        </ul>
